I was incredibly fortunate to work with Fernanda Echavarri on her excellent but heartbreaking story about a family who went through the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) for Mother Jones. The story, titled “One Family’s Escape From Trump’s Border Hell: A 130-Week Diary” was published online on June 4, 2021 and in print for the September/October issue.
