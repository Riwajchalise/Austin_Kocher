Former President Barack Obama, for example, issued  similar guidelines to limit enforcement to public safety risks and  recent entrants. But not all ICE officers followed them, according to  Austin Kocher, a faculty fellow at TRAC.

“The  research that we did showed that even though the Obama administration  had the policies, ICE officers were still doing whatever they wanted,”  Kocher said. “The Biden administration seems to be aware of this  criticism in the past, but the jury is still out at the moment.”
