"Altogether, about 28,000 migrants in MPP received deportation orders without even being in the courtroom at the time," he said. 

TRAC data sh ows just over 10,000 people with active MPP cases have been allowed to enter the U.S. under Biden so far. Many with closed cases now get to make their case again, but Kocher said the first hurdle will be locating them to give them the news. 

"It's not like they left a forwarding address," he said. "These are individuals who believe their cases are over, so I’d be surprised to see if they’re able to find 40% of the people with these closed cases to actually go through the process of registering and coming into the country."
