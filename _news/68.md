Austin Kocher, a researcher at Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse of Syracuse University, told Border Report that he expects this to be challenged in court.

“It certainly represents a really complicated and quite troubling jurisdictional question to have state law enforcement agencies essentially trying to usurp the role of the federal government. The Supreme Court has ruled many many times in the last decades that immigration enforcement is the purview of the federal government and typically courts don’t like it when states try to take on that role or politicize immigration enforcement within states itself so it will be interesting to see how this plays out,” Kocher said. “I have no doubt this will be challenged in court at some point and definitely represents a complicated picture.”

Kocher added that he is concerned about the process that state troopers and Texas National Guard troops will use to identify potential migrants and whether it could prompt racial profiling.

“If you’re not trained as an immigration officer of some kind how do you know who is undocumented and how do you know who crossed the border unlawfully into the country?” Kocher said.
