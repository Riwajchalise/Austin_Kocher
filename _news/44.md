A total of 11,847 asylum-seekers were placed into the Dedicated Docket program last month — an 81% increase from those placed into the program through July, Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), a Syracuse University research institute that tracks immigration court cases reported Monday.

Data released Monday, however, shows an uptick in placements that have resulted in an estimated 6,000 families or an average of almost 400 asylum-seekers per day. The total number of individuals in the program is now almost 17,000, TRAC reports.

TRAC data also shows that six immigration judges in the country have a total of 66% — or two-thirds — of all fast-tracked cases in the country. The courts with the most cases are in New York City and Boston, TRAC data shows.

“So it does raise questions about how those immigration judges are going to be able to manage that high volume of cases and move them through in a timeframe that the administration would like,” Austin Kocher, a TRAC researcher, told Border Report on Monday.

“More than one-third of cases identified as being on the Dedicated Docket don’t actually have that Dedicated Docket flag so that does raise questions as to how the courts will report on this,” Kocher said.

He noted that “it does take human time and labor to do this and the courts are backlogged as we know and have a lot on their plate.”
