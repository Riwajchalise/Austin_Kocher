Austin Kocher, a researcher with the nonprofit organization Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) of Syracuse University, said the international community is watching to see how Ukrainian refugees will be treated at the Southwest border, especially since so many asylum seekers of color, from Central and South America and Haiti have been expelled and deported under Title 42.

…

“It will be very interesting to see how the administration will handle this given that they have now flown many Haitian refugees back to Haiti on deportation flights over the last several months that has been so controversial for turning those refugees back,” Kocher said. “The U.S. will now have to contend with some of the refugee-receiving issues that countries in Europe have had to contend with, which is wait why are you letting these refugees come across as legitimate refugees when you are deporting others? … In Europe, it was North African and Syrian migrants, many of whom were turned back. In the United States it’s been often Black and LatinX refugees who have been turned back.”
