That would help to alleviate certain responsibilities from U.S. immigration court judges, TRAC researcher Austin Kocher told Border Report on Thursday.

“The combination of hiring more immigration judges and moving many asylum cases out of the immigration courts could help the immigration court backlog considerably,” he said.

He added that historically, asylum applications processed by USCIS are granted at a higher rate than by immigration judges.

“So this new rule could result in much higher rates of approval than before,” Kocher said.

…

DHS “controls the flow of cases, not the courts. If they keep the spigot turned on high, no amount of judges are going to be able to keep up,” Kocher said. “DHS has to stop trying to deport everyone.”
