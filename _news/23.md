Austin Kocher with the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University tracks immigration trends and said most detainees are likely coming from one place.

“ICE arrests and detentions remain remarkably low across the board, really historic lows. And they just have really not gone back up at all, which means interior enforcement is clearly not a priority at this point for this administration. But border arrests and detentions have,” Kocher said, referring to the Biden administration.
