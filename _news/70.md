TRAC researcher Austin Kocher says the program has expanded rapidly since 2021. 

“The biggest growth we’ve seen is in SmartLINK technology where someone has a smartphone and that smartphone itself is linked to ICE and that is used as a case management tool for tracking,” Kocher told Border Report last year.

When selecting migrants for entry in the ATD program, DHS considers their criminal and immigration history; supervision history; family and community ties; status as a caregiver or provider, as well as other humanitarian or medical considerations.

If an individual fails to respond to a SmartLINK app notification they could be subject to re-arrest and removal or deportation proceedings, Kocher said.

Most migrants given the SmartLINK app come through South Texas. As of June 20, there were 39,615 migrants loaned the special phones out of the ICE office in Harlingen, Texas, and 34,115 from the San Antonio office, according to TRAC.
