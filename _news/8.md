Researcher Austin Kocher, a faculty fellow with TRAC, says the data “show growing numbers of domestic terrorism prosecutions over the past two years, in particular cases in Washington, D.C., stemming from the Jan. 6 insurrection.

“…Federal prosecutors and judges have their hands full with an unprecedented influx of terrorism cases that may be complex and are, at the same, also highly political and controversial.”

While the number of domestic terror cases is showing a dramatic increase, the number of international terror cases in the U.S. is at “the lowest [point] since before 9/11,” according to the same TRAC report.

Kocher said the increase “challenges us all to rethink where terrorism is really coming from.”

“When it comes to terrorism, the threat is internal, not external,” he said.
