As the number of immigrants monitored under ATD has ticked up, the number in ICE detention centers has declined. But it’s not a direct one-to-one correlation, says Austin Kocher, assistant professor and researcher at TRAC. The number of immigrants in ATD has expanded, while the number of people in immigrant detention facilities has fluctuated, he says. “[ATD] is more of a mechanism for [ICE] to expand their ability to monitor immigrants who are in the country,” Kocher says. “So we don’t necessarily expect the detention numbers to go down just because Alternatives To Detention is increasing.” Since the start of the Biden Administration, the number of immigrants in ICE detention centers has ranged from a high of 27,217 and a low of 13,258. It’s currently above 18,000.
