“The Biden administration’s new Alternatives to Detention case management approach appears to be driven by longstanding concerns that immigrants facing deportation often lack adequate legal and social support services. Not only does the lack of services undermine immigrants’ ability to present a full and accurate case, it also creates administrative challenges for the immigration courts that impacts efficiency. It remains to be seen just how this new Alternatives to Detention approach will work in practice, but it could be a step in the right direction,” Austin Kocher, a researcher with Transactional Research Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) of Syracuse University, a nonprofit that tracks all immigration court cases nationwide.
