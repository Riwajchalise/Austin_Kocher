Overall federal prosecutions of all offenses were down 38% in January compared to the same month five years ago and down 9% from a year ago, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Record Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, which analyzes immigration data.

“Unlawful entry prosecutions — which make up the vast majority of federal court cases in general — those charges completely bottomed out and haven’t recovered,” said Austin Kocher, assistant professor at Syracuse University.

There were 24 unlawful entry prosecutions in September 2021, compared to more than 8,000 in September 2018, according to TRAC. Unlawful re-entry prosecutions topped 1,000 in September 2021, less than a third of monthly totals before the pandemic.

“It’s 100% Title 42,” he said. “Everyone who would have been prosecuted is getting just turned away. I would fully expect those federal prosecution numbers to shoot way back up.”
