Austin Kocher, a research assistant professor, said the volume of Lake Charles cases has skyrocketed in recent months and shows no signs of slowing down.

“The sheer volume of civil insurance lawsuits in Southwest Louisiana is enormous and continues to grow even two years later, illustrating the fact that when inadequate support structures are in place, extreme weather events continue to wreak havoc in communities long after the winds subside,” Kocher told the Louisiana Record in an email.
