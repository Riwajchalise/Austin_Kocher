“The Biden administration, like each presidential administration that has come before, appears to be experimenting with new approaches to managing the massive number of pending cases. The Dedicated Docket is the latest in a long line of attempts to accelerate new cases,” Austin Kocher, a TRAC researcher said Tuesday. 

Kocher cautioned, however, that it’s uncertain whether the dedicated docket is actually helping to expedite cases or just shuffle them around.

“In the past, programs like the Dedicated Docket have done more to create confusion and shuffle cases around than to solve the underlying systemic programs faced by the court. It remains to be seen whether the Biden administration will stick to this program and if the Dedicated Docket will have positive or negative effects on immigration judges’ workloads,” Kocher said.
