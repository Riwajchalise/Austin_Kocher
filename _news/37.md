"It raises questions both about how disruptive this may be for the immigration court system and for immigration judges. When you move cases around, it's not as if you're moving them in a vacuum. Other cases have to move. So these cases may move quicker, but other cases may move slower," Austin Kocher, PhD, TRAC assistant research professor, said.

The goal of the “Dedicated Docket” program is to have a decision within 300 days of the family’s initial master calendar hearing. TRAC statistics show the initial hearing could still take months.

"I think there's also legitimate questions about whether the administration will really be able to keep its commitment to due process and fairness. Sometimes when cases move quickly, if those individuals aren't given the support and the legal counsel and don't have access to an attorney, cases that move quickly can actually create barriers for those individuals to really have the time to put together a full case and find an attorney," Kocher said.

"While the goal of this process is to decide cases expeditiously, fairness will not be compromised," the press release shows.
