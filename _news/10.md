Austin Kocher, a researcher with the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, said the organization's most recent analysis, from May, showed that more than 10,400 MPP cases had been transferred from the border to immigration courts in other parts of the country.

"Regardless of the Supreme Court decision, I think the most important thing to know is that MPP is not over," he said.

Kocher added that TRAC will continue to follow the process and outcome of MPP cases, which could take years, given the massive 1.3 million case backlog in immigration courts. 

"It's not the thing that the government can terminate the program and we don't have to think about it anymore, it's so important for people to know that this is going to impact thousands and thousands of people for years to come," he said.
