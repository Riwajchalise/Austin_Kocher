“What we’re seeing is just a slow down in terms of the number of cases that are transferred into the country,” Austin Kocher, a lead researcher for TRAC told Border Report on Friday.

Kocher speculates that the Biden administration is having trouble reaching folks who tried to claim asylum and were put in MPP. Since President Joe Biden took office, his administration has worked with nonprofit organizations to help identify migrants placed in MPP and to help earmark those eligible to enter the United States.

…

“The big picture here is that MPP has had its effect and even with the Biden administration trying to create alternatives for people, it looks like by and large the people who were discouraged and prevented from applying for asylum have been affectively discouraged and prevented and there may not be a meaningful remedy,” Kocher said.
