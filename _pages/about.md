# About Page

I am a Research Assistant Professor in the Newhouse School of Public Communication and a researcher with the [Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC)](https://trac.syr.edu/), an institute at Syracuse University that uses Freedom of Information Act requests to study the federal government. 

I graduated with my PhD from The Ohio State University's [Department of Geography](https://geography.osu.edu/) in 2017, where I also previously earned my MA and BA in geography. Prior to joining Syracuse University, I taught at Western Governors University and the University of Michigan-Dearborn.
