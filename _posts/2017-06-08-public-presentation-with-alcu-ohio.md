**Update**: Thank you to the ACLU and Katrice Williams for coordinating the event last night. Good luck to the participants from Painesville, Ohio, who are organizing against the anti-immigrant policies of the local city council and police department.

On Tuesday, June 13, I will be speaking at an ACLU-sponsored event in Cleveland, Ohio about how Trump's immigration enforcement agenda is similar and different than the Obama years, and sharing practical projects that immigrants and attorneys are taking in light of the election. I appreciate the ACLU's invitation to share my dissertation research and public engagement. Click on the link below for more information.
