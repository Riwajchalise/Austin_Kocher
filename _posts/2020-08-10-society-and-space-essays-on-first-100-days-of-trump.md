I'm glad to report that a series of essays that I organized and co-edited is now available online from Society & Space Open Site. Taken together, these essays provide a useful, timely, and very readable analysis of how immigration enforcement is changing (and not changing) under the Trump administration. Check them out! Special thanks to the authors: Geoff Boyce, Nancy Hiemstra, Dee Conlon, Jeremy Marshall, and Patricia Ehrkamp. Thanks for support at Society & Space from Lauren Martin and Darshan Vigneswaran. For the essay, click here [SOCIETY & SPACE](http://societyandspace.org/2017/07/04/trump-and-immigration-enforcement-the-first-100-days/)Â or click the image below.
