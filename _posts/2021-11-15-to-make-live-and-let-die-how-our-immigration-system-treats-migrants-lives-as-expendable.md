As Texas remains a frequent destination for migrants crossing the border into the United States, understanding the state's immigration courts remains valuable to the news media and the public. New data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse ([TRAC](https://trac.syr.edu/)) at Syracuse University provides a breakdown of new cases filed at the Houston immigration court, the number of pending immigration cases, and outcomes of asylum cases. 

Data about the Houston immigration court updated through the end of August 2021 can be found below. Although Houston is home to three separate courts, this data reflects the [main Houston court](https://www.justice.gov/eoir/houston-immigration-court) with the most cases in our dataset. The interactive tools that TRAC provides allows journalists to identify data they need based on their beat, stories, or interests. The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse ([TRAC](https://trac.syr.edu/)) is a non-partisan academic research institute at Syracuse University that studies the federal government.
